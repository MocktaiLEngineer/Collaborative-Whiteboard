# Collaborative Whiteboard

* This is the repository for Internet and Cloud Computing (CO7219) semester project - Cloud based Collaborative Whiteboard.
  
* The major goal for this project is to implement a web-application which would allow multiple users to simultaneously draw on the whiteboard.
* Preferred strong consistency over eventual consistency to make the application work real-time.
