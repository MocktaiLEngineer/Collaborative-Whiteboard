# Collaborative Whiteboard

* This is the repository for Internet and Cloud Computing (CO7219) semester project - Cloud based Collaborative Whiteboard.
  
* The major goal for this project is to implement a web-application which would allow multiple users (across the globe) to simultaneously draw on the whiteboard.

* Preferred strong consistency over eventual consistency to make the application work real-time.

* For additional details, kindly refer to Collaborative Whiteboard.pdf
